MessageBox.information(qsTr("                                 A NOTE REGARDING HOOKS & FLIES:\n\nThe WEARABLE versions of the HOOKS and FLIES are parented to the LEADER bone of the CAST LINE (Bone 503). In order for them to be parented correctly, please be sure to select the CAST LINE root node before loading your chosen bait. This can be found just after the 7th bone of the FLY LINE, here:\n\n           FLY ROD > FLY LINE > FREE LINE > FIXED LINE 01-07 > CAST LINE\n\nThis will ensure that the HOOKS and FLIES remain correcty attached to the end of the LEADER as you cast your line out over the water. Be sure to load a HOOK first before adding your FLY of choice, as the FLIES do not load with a HOOK.\n\nAlso be aware that if you are using the NARROW HOOK, you will need to adjust your fly slightly along the Z AXIS (a value of 0.58 is good) to account for its straight tang, as the default loading position is for the bent tang of the WIDE HOOK. Happy fishing!\n\n           -The Alchemist"), qsTr("Infomation"), qsTr("&OK") );
